## Repository description
The folder *preprocessing_scripts* contains the preprocessing scripts for three dataset, that preprocess the data before it is used for training in the Hydra model. The scripts are separated for each dataset. The *segmentation_mask* module, that creates segmentation mask given contour points of tumors, is available and used in two datasets.

The *Pipfile* and *Pipfile.lock* are here to install a virtual environment on a new machine that wants to run these scripts.

The original publication of this work is also attached in the *main.pdf* PDF file.
