# Pre-Processing Segmentation Datasets For The Hydra Framework

Author: Christophe Broillet

## Abstract
blablabla

## Repository description
The folder *preprocessing_scripts* contains the preprocessing scripts for three datasets. These scripts preprocess the data before the Hydra model uses it. The scripts are separated for each dataset. The *segmentation_mask* module, that creates segmentation masks given the list of points that contour tumors, is available and used in two datasets.

The *Pipfile* and *Pipfile.lock* are here to install a virtual environment on a new machine that wants to run these scripts.

The original publication of this work is available here **ADD LINK TO EXASCALE LAB** or in the attached *main.pdf* file.
