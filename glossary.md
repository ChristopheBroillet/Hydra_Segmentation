# Glossary

## Biopsy
Medical test, extracting of samples cells  or tissues to determine the presence or extent of a disease.

## MRI (medical resonance imaging) sequence
The MRI is a medical imaging using strong magnetic fields. A sequence is a particular setting of pulse sequences and pulsed field fradients, resulting in a particula image appearance. Examples :

- **T2 weighted**
- **DWI (diffusion weighted images)**
- **ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient)**

MRI can only see soft tissues, but not hard ones.

## CT (computerized tomography) scans, tomodensitom√©trie
The CT scan is a medical imaging using X-rays. It can see hard tissues (like bones).

## Reference system in anatomy

- **Sagittal**, from left to right (ear to ear)
- **Transversal**, from up to down (head to feet)
- **Coronal** (or frontal), from front to back (nose to back)

## DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)
Format/extension for MRI, containing images and metadata (patient ID, bits per channel, ...)

## PAX
System in the HFR where we can see the images, make the diagnosis, see the patients, etc...

## Gleason score
Score to grade/classify a prostate cancer according to aggression, by looking the cells under a miscroscope after a biopsy. Goes from 6 (lowest grade cancer) to 10. Cells in prostate are classified in 5 patterns. After a biopsy, the pathologist assign a first grade (from 1 to 5, but pathologists rarely put 1 or 2) to the most predominant pattern, and a second grade to the second most dominant pattern. A score can be for example 3+4 (=7). \

## PSA (Prostate specific antigen) score
The PSA is a protein produced by cells in the prostate. One can mesure the level of PSA by directly in a man's blood. A man who has a prostate cancer will have a bigger level of PSA in his blood. A level of PSA between 4 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml can indicate cancer. \

## PIRADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) score
Score to put a likelihood of an MRI to contain a tumor. It is an interpretation on the MRI, and not on the actual cells (like the Gleason score with the real cells). It ranges from 1 (almost certainly of absence of cancer) to 5 (cancer presence is very likely), and 3 being a 50% chance of having cancer. We can write several PIRADS scores, if we have more than one tumor. \

## TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging
System to stage a prostate cancer. Tumor is divided in 4 stages (T1 to T4). For each stage, letters are added to add information about the cancer. For example, T1b, T3c, T4a, etc...\

## Prostatectomy
Surgical procedure to remove all or a part of the prostate gland. Used to then killed the tumor by irradiation.
