# Glossary

## Biopsy
Medical test, extracting of samples cells  or tissues to determine the presence or extent of a disease.

## MRI (medical resonance imaging) sequence
The MRI is a medical imaging using strong magnetic fields. A sequence is a particular setting of pulse sequences and pulsed field fradients, resulting in a particula image appearance. Examples :

- **T2 weighted**
- **DWI (diffusion weighted images)**
- **ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient)**

MRI can only see soft tissues, but not hard ones.

## CT (computerized tomography) scans, tomodensitom√©trie
The CT scan is a medical imaging using X-rays. It can see hard tissues (like bones).

## Reference system in anatomy

- **Sagittal**, from left to right (ear to ear)
- **Transversal**, from up to down (head to feet)
- **Coronal** (or frontal), from front to back (nose to back)
