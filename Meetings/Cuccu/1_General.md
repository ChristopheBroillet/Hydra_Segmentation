## Material
Read the 2 thesis and ask questions

## Thesis work
MRI (variation in density, slice of images, 3 sequences (one in each dimension) to have the same resolution in the 3 axes, dimensionality more than 3 because of the time and the type of scan, so very difficult to dimensionality) Data processing, 1000 patients will need to be anonymized, work with radiologist, make an automatic tool to:
1. Segmentation (perimeter/boundary, dimensionality)
2. Cancer diagnosis (yes or no malignant mass (piece of tissue), with 1 neuron with prob)
3. Location (x,y mass center, with two neurons)
4. Level of certitude

There are the labels for SL, **biopsy** (control to be sure by taking tissue inside a patient)

## Bureaucracy
Sign a paper after the work,supervisor Cudré-Mauroux,
**14:00 24th august on the parking main entrance of the HFR**

## Schedule
Weekly meeting with Cuccu, and in HFR, maternal, 30min weekly meeting (on Thursday 13:00) with Cuccu to be consistent and short, meeting for the data and the whole project

## Tools
* Latex + template (overleaf good for more people, google docs for the text, otherwise in local)
* Python + Jupiter
* Linux mint distribution with cinnamon (work locally, but access to other servers, or on computers of the HFR)
* GitHub
* Coding env
* Lists (todo list (prioritization) and wish list (becoming a researcher)) (markdown), ATOM or sublime text

**Meeting every Thursday between 13:00pm – 13:30pm**

# 26 August 2021
We speak a little bit about the first version of the renamer.py. Mr. Cuccu tell me that I needed to learn some useful shortcuts for ATOM, place the comments in the code in the line above, try to learn the English keyboard.

I need also to read again my notes about the technical stuff for the thesis, that means the medical stuff, in link with the MRI, prostate, DICOM, and the related libraries in Python. I need also to install a jupyter notebook, it is easier to see the things (like dicoms).

# 2 September 2021
Today I show Mr. Cuccu my jupyter notebook, and what can Pydicom do in general.
