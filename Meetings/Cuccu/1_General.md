MRI (variation in density, slice of images, 3 sequences (one in each dimension) to have the same resolution in the 3 axes, dimensionality more than 3 because of the time and the type of scan, so very difficult to dimensionality) Data processing, 1000 patients will need to be anonymized, work with radiologist, make an automatic tool to:
1. Segmentation (perimeter/boundary, dimensionality)
2. Cancer diagnosis (yes or no malignant mass (piece of tissue), with 1 neuron with prob)
3. Location (x,y mass center, with two neurons)
4. Level of certitude

There are the labels for SL, **biopsy** (control to be sure by taking tissue inside a patient)
